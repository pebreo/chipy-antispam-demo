A ChiPy AntiSpam Demo=====================Author: Paul EbreoExperience level: newbieInterests: Python, Django, and JavascriptPurpose=======A common problem with maintaining a website is filtering out spam.This Django project demonstrates how to implement a "honeypot" approach tofilter spam from the ChiPy RSVP submission form. Basic Algorithm===============A honeypot is any enticing object or resource that is meant to attract antagonists into doing their unwanted behavior, at the same time alerting the person trying to fight the unwanted behavior. In this case, the unwanted behavior is spambots automatically filling out the the ChiPy RSVP form. The honeypotwill be hidden HTML fields which our Django view will perform logic on.I  added two extra form fields to the RSVP popup dialog and hid them usingjQuery. Those two fields are the "address" field and "phone" field.Spambots will indiscriminately fill out the fields and our Django view willhandle the POST data appropriately: reject any form submits that have the hidden "phone" or "address" filled out. That's the basic gist of it.Django unittests============For this project I made 7 unit test methods.Form submission test:1) Test the RSVP submit view handling valid data2) Test the RSVP submit view handling invalid dataRSVP ListView test:3) Test the ListView to handle no people on the rsvp list4) Test the ListView to handle when people are on the listMain page test:5) Test the index view to handle the home page with valid contexts6) Test the index view to handle invalid contextsMessage page test:7) Test a view that handles "About", "Recent Topics", "Give a Talk", "Contact" and "Login" links on home pageInstall & Requirements======================This project utilizes:-Django 1.5-Psycopg2 To install this project just clone this repo and change the local_setting.pyto your local postgresql db settings and login information.Just change the local_settings.py db information to run it on your system. In my caseI installed PostgreSQL with the following setup:db name: postgresdb username: postgrespw: 1234PORT: 54321
